# Tree Cover Gain Analysis (2000-2020): A Geospatial Exploration

## Overview

This project visualizes the global tree cover gain from 2000 to 2020 to better understand forest dynamics and their potential environmental impacts. This research is closely aligned with the theme "Create a Data Science Workflow in the Metaverse of DePin: Tokeneconomy and Geospatial Analysis for Social Good and Sustainability." Through this geospatial analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights for social good and sustainability, particularly within the framework of decentralized digital economies (DePin) and the metaverse.

## Data Description

### Meta Data Infomation
The dataset used in this study was developed by the Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) lab at the University of Maryland. It utilizes NASA GEDI lidar measurements and Landsat time-series data to assess global tree cover gain from 2000 to 2020. The data has a resolution of 30 Ã— 30 meters, providing detailed information on a global scale.

## KINME Workflow
The geospatial analysis workflow for this project was built using KINME (https://www.knime.com/), integrating the full process of data loading, processing, analysis, and visualization.

### Step by Step Creation
- **Data Loading:** The tree cover gain data was downloaded from Global Forest Watch and imported into the KINME workflow.
  - **CSV Reader:** This node reads data from a CSV file and loads it into the KNIME platform. It's typically the first step in a workflow that involves data processing.

- **Data Processing:** Specific filtering and transformation operations were applied to the raw data to prepare it for analysis.
  - **Table Row to Variable Loop Start:** This node initiates a loop in the workflow. It converts each row of a table into a set of flow variables, allowing you to process each row separately in a loop.

  - **OSM Boundary Map:** This node retrieves boundary data (such as country or region borders) from OpenStreetMap (OSM). It's used to get geographical boundaries for further spatial analysis.

  - **Loop End:** This node marks the end of the loop initiated by the "Table Row to Variable Loop Start" node. It collects the results of each iteration and outputs them as a single table.

  - **Projection:** This node changes the coordinate system of the geospatial data. It is typically used to ensure that all spatial data uses a consistent coordinate system for analysis.

  - **Joiner:** This node merges or joins two datasets based on a common key (like an ID or geographic coordinate). It's often used to combine geospatial data with other data types.

- **Visualization:** Maps were generated showing the distribution of countries and tree cover gain areas in hectares for each country.
  - **Geospatial View:** This node visualizes geospatial data on an interactive map. It allows you to explore and analyze spatial relationships visually.

  - **Geospatial View Static:** This node creates a static (non-interactive) map view of the geospatial data. It's useful for generating map images for reports or presentations.

## Future Research Directions
This research can be further expanded to better serve the theme "Create a Data Science Workflow in the Metaverse of DePin: Tokeneconomy and Geospatial Analysis for Social Good and Sustainability." Potential directions include:
- **Integration with DePin Ecosystem:** Combine tree cover gain data with the tokenomics of the DePin platform to explore how blockchain technology can incentivize reforestation and forest conservation activities.
- **Quantitative Analysis for Social Good:** Use the data to assess the socio-economic impacts of forest recovery globally and regionally, exploring how decentralized platforms and the metaverse can achieve social good objectives.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Collaborate with experts in environmental science, economics, sociology, and other fields to study the impact of different environmental governance policies on tree cover gain and how technology can support sustainable development.
